# Agario
This is an Agario like game made in Python mainly using PyGame library. It was created as a project of Advanced Python Course during my studies. It has capability to play over the network. 

#### Usage
In the current stage, game is playable by running it directly from source code files. In order to play the game you have to complete a few steps:
* Make sure you have installed required packages - there is **requirements.txt** file in repository that lists all the required packages needed to run the game. This file has appropriate format so all you need to do to install these packages is to type the command: ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` (of course you have to have ```pip``` installed).
* Run the game server with command ```python server.py```.
* Run the game with command ```python game.py```.
